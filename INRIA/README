This model was trained using the PASCAL VOC compatible INRIA annotations and 
devkit. You can download them from:
http://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~rbg/INRIA_PASCAL.tgz.

This archive does not include the images -- it's just the annotations and a 
PASCAL-compatible directory structure for holding the VOCdevkit, images, and 
annotations. To get the images, download 
http://pascal.inrialpes.fr/data/human/INRIAPerson.tar and then copy the 
following files:

cp INRIAPerson/Test/neg/* INRIA_PASCAL/VOCdevkit/VOC2007/Images/
cp INRIAPerson/Test/pos/* INRIA_PASCAL/VOCdevkit/VOC2007/Images/
cp INRIAPerson/Train/neg/* INRIA_PASCAL/VOCdevkit/VOC2007/Images/
cp INRIAPerson/Train/pos/* INRIA_PASCAL/VOCdevkit/VOC2007/Images/

To train an INRIA pedestrian model, change the pascal.dev_kit configuration 
in voc_config.m.

conf = cv(conf, 'pascal.dev_kit', [conf.paths.base_dir '/INRIA/VOCdevkit/']);

(Make sure you've extracted the archive so it's in the location above.)

Then train the model by running:

>> global VOC_CONFIG_OVERRIDE;
>> VOC_CONFIG_OVERRIDE = @voc_config_inriaperson;
>> pascal('inriaperson', 1);

That should reproduce the released model.
