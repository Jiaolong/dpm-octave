1) minConf by Mark Schmidt

Used as an L-BFGS optimization blackbox for solving convex slave problems.
Our convex slave problems are not smooth, but L-BFGS seems to work well
with the subgradients of our objective. Box contraints are used to prevent
quadratic deformation parameters from becomes too small (or negative).

Modifications:
  - removed unneeded directories and files.
  - matlab/svmpredict.c: remove mexPrintf of accuracy
  - matlab/svmtrain.c: print_string_matlab now executes a drawNow to 
    flush the print buffer


3) Boost Preprocessor Library

Used for metaprogramming. One convolution routine binary is generated 
for each feature dimension with the inner most loop unrolled the
appropriate number of times.
