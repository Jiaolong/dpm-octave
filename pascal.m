function pascal(cls, n, note, dotrainval, testyear)
% Train and evaluate a model. 
%   pascal(cls, n, note, dotrainval, testyear)
%
%   The model will be a mixture of n star models, each of which
%   has 2 latent orientations.
%
% Arguments
%   cls           Object class to train and evaluate
%   n             Number of aspect ratio clusters to use
%                 (The final model has 2*n components)
%   note          Save a note in the model.note field that describes this model
%   dotrainval    Also evaluate on the trainval dataset
%                 This is used to collect training data for context rescoring
%   testyear      Test set year (e.g., '2007', '2011')
