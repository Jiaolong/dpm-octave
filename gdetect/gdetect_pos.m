%
%   This function computes the belief s* for a foreground example (x,y):
%     s* = \argmax_{s \in S(x)} w \dot \psi(x,s) - L_output(y,s)
%   The loss function L_output(y,s) is 0 if y and s have overlap with fg_box
%   > fg_overlap, and is +inf otherwise.
%
%   If count > 1, then this function also computes up to conf.training.wlssvm_M
%   loss adjusted detections that violate the margin:
%     \argmax_{s \in S(x)} w \dot \psi(x,s) + L_margin(y,s)
%   The set of valid outputs S(x) is defined (here and above) to be all 
%   detection windows that have at least 0.1 overlap with fg_box and no 
%   more than max_bg_overlap with any bg_boxes.
%
%   Workflow:
%   Call gdetect_pos_prepare once per foreground image I,
%   then call gdetect_pos once per foreground bounding box in I
% 
% Return values (see gdetect.m)
%   Important note: by convention the first entry in dets, boxes, and trees
%   is the belief for this foreground example. Any following detections
%   are loss adjusted detections for use with WL-SSVM.
%
% Arguments
%   model           Object model 
%                   (augmented with DP tables from gdetect_dp.m)
%   pyra            Feature pyramid 
%                   (augmented with overlaps from gdetect_pos_prepare.m)
%   fg_box          Selected foreground bounding box index
%   fg_overlap      Required overlap between fg_box and the returned belief
%                   Implements L_output(y,s) in the WL-SSVM
%   bg_boxes        Indices of non-selected bounding boxes in image
%   max_bg_overlap  Maximum allowed amount of overlap with bg bounding boxes
%                   Implements S(x) in WL-SSVM
