function overlaps = compute_overlaps(pyra, model, boxes)
% Compute intersection over union overlap between each detection window
% in the model and each bounding box in boxes at every detection window
% position in the input feature pyramid.
%   overlaps = compute_overlaps(pyra, model, boxes)
%
% Return value
%   overlaps    Array struct storing overlap values (more details below)               
%
% Arguments
%   pyra
%   model
%   boxes
%
% The overlaps structure:
%   The computed overlap values are organized into
%     overlaps(c).box(b).o{l},
%   where c is a top-level rule (i.e. component) index,
%   b specifies the bounding box boxes(b,:), and
%   l is a feature pyramid level.
%   The value stored in overlaps(c).box(b).o{l} is a matrix
%   with the same size as pyra.feat{l}. Each matrix entry
%   is the intersection over union overlap between the detection
%   window for component c and the bounding box boxes(b,:).
