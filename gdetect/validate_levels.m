function do_levels = validate_levels(model, pyra, boxes, overlap)
% Determine which feature pyramid levels permit high overlap between
% the model and any of the input boxes.
%   do_levels = validate_levels(model, pyra, boxes, overlap)
%
% Return value
%   do_levels   Boolean array indicating on which feature pyramid levels 
%               we need to compute convolutions
%
% Arguments
%   model       Object model
%   pyra        Feature pyramid
%   boxes       Ground truth bounding boxes
%   overlap     Overlap threshold
