function [ds, bs, trees] = gdetect_pos_c(pyra, model, valid)
% Compute belief and loss adjusted detections for a foreground example.
%   [ds, bs, trees] = gdetect_pos(pyra, model, count, ...
%                                 fg_box, fg_overlap, ...
%                                 bg_boxes, max_bg_overlap)
%
%   This function computes the belief s* for a foreground example (x,y):
%     s* = \argmax_{s \in S(x)} w \dot \psi(x,s) - L_output(y,s)
%   The loss function L_output(y,s) is 0 if y and s have overlap with fg_box
%   > fg_overlap, and is +inf otherwise.
%
%   If count > 1, then this function also computes up to conf.training.wlssvm_M
%   loss adjusted detections that violate the margin:
%     \argmax_{s \in S(x)} w \dot \psi(x,s) + L_margin(y,s)
%   The set of valid outputs S(x) is defined (here and above) to be all 
%   detection windows that have at least 0.1 overlap with fg_box and no 
%   more than max_bg_overlap with any bg_boxes.
%
%   Workflow:
%   Call gdetect_pos_prepare once per foreground image I,
%   then call gdetect_pos once per foreground bounding box in I
% 
% Return values (see gdetect.m)
%   Important note: by convention the first entry in dets, boxes, and trees
%   is the belief for this foreground example. Any following detections
%   are loss adjusted detections for use with WL-SSVM.
%
